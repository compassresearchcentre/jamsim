JAMSIM is a framework for creating microsimulation models in Java. It provides code and packages for common [features](https://github.com/compassresearchcentre/jamsim/wiki/Features) of microsimulation models for end users.

JAMSIM models run as standalone programs with a friendly GUI without requiring technical expertise. For further details see the [requirements outline](https://github.com/compassresearchcentre/jamsim/wiki/RequirementsSpec) or this [JAMSIM paper](http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/15/1/8.html).

The JAMSIM code consists of a number of [third party packages](https://github.com/compassresearchcentre/jamsim/wiki/ThirdPartyPackages) and the integration glue to bind them together.

To run the JAMSIM Example Model (JEM), which demonstrates the features of JAMSIM, consult the [Usage](https://github.com/compassresearchcentre/jamsim/wiki/Usage) page.

JAMSIM can be easily integration with [simario](http://code.google.com/p/simario/) in which case it functions as the user interface and simario provides the simulation engine.
